  / Shiny 1.4 bumped jQuery from 1.x to 3.x which means jQuery's
  / on-ready handler (i.e., $(fn)) is now asyncronous (i.e., it now
  / really means $(setTimeout(fn)).
  / https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#breaking-change-document-ready-handlers-are-now-asynchronous
  /
  / Since Shiny uses $() to schedule initShiny, shiny>=1.4 calls initShiny
  / one tick later than it did before, which means staticRender() is
  / called renderValue() earlier than (advanced) widget authors might be expecting.
  / https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/2630
  /
  / For a concrete example, leaflet has some methods (e.g., updateBounds)
  / which reference Shiny methods registered in initShiny (e.g., setInputValue).
  / Since leaflet is privy to this life-cycle, it knows to use setTimeout() to
  / delay execution of those methods (until Shiny methods are ready)
  / https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/blob/18ec981/javascript/src/index.js#L266-L268
  /
  / Ideally widget authors wouldn't need to use this setTimeout() hack that
  / leaflet uses to call Shiny methods on a staticRender(). In the long run,
  / the logic initShiny should be broken up so that method registration happens
  / right away, but binding happens later.

<h1>dbplyr - Out-Source Your Data With TidyVerse</h1>
<p><strong>dbplyr is a great tool for unloading heavy amounts of data from RStudio and onto a SQL server. dbplyr is good choice when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have a data heavy environment that is slowing down your local machine</li>
<li>Your knits are taking forever</li>
<li>You have many files that access the same data and you don’t want to reload from csv everytime</li>
<li>You are working in a group</li>
</ul>
<div id="set-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Set Up</h2>
<p>dbplyr works with a SQL server to retrive data and make it available as a dataframe on your local machine. dbplyr handels the SQL queries on the back end to directly interface with the server and returns an object you can further manipulate using standard Tidyverse tools.</p>
<p>I will show a simple way to create a new database and populate it with data before demostrating how to use dbplyr.</p>
<p>You will need another package to access the SQL server of your choice. dbplyr works very well with standard, well-known SQL server packages. I will be using <code>RMySQL</code> and Google Cloud SQL for this example. SQLite is very popular for demostration purposes, but is not as practical in a real-world scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Reproducability:</strong> The set up code for the SQL database is in markdown as I only need to run it once.</p>
<div id="create-a-new-database-on-your-server" class="section level3">
<h3>Create a new database on your server</h3>
<p>Before we can get to dbplyr we need data and a SQL instance to tap into. Below is a very easy set up using the <code>RMySQL</code> package. You only need to use the follow code chunk once and the DB will be there as long as you keep it on your SQL server. One of the many wonderful things about storing and accessing data this way is that you only need to create one cloud instance and R and RMySQL can handle the rest - this is far superior to using MySQL workbench or some other software on your local machine.</p>

<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11"></a>dbSendQuery(conn, &quot;CREATE DATABASE Congress_v_Trump;&quot;)  </span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, let the server know you intend to use the DB you created. If starting a new session (after creating the data), establish a connection and identify the database name.</p>

<p>The data is stored on a <code>.csv</code> file and we can load the <code>.csv</code> as dataframe and use <code>RMySQL</code> to write that dataframe to our cloud database.</p>
<p><strong>You only need to do this once. The data will stay on your SQL server as long as you want.</strong></p>

<h2>dbplyr</h2>
<p>If you have used any dplyr functions before you’ll be very happy to know that almost everything is the same for dbplyr! I’ll show a few common use-cases as well as some places where dbplyr is different form dplyr.</p>
<div id="tbl" class="section level3">
<h3>tbl()</h3>
<p>First, you need to let dbplyr know that you are using a database by pointing to a database and table. It’s one line - tell dbplyr the connection and name of the database.</p>
<p><strong>If you use a html display for your data (DT in this case), you’ll have to cast the variable assigned to <code>tbl()</code> explicitly with <code>as.data.frame()</code></strong></p>

<p>Now we are ready to use dbplyr to query the database!</p>
<p>Let’s start with a simple SQL query as an example. We will find a given individual and aggregate their average agreement (agree_pct) with the president and their average number of votes in alignment with the president (net_trump_vote).</p>

<p>If we want to do more data cleaning and have the full use of tidyr or dplyr functions we will need to use dbplyr to pull down a subset of the database and store it in local memory. <strong>Note:</strong> Use the <code>collect()</code> function to save to the local memory. Also use <code>collect()</code> to make use of the <code>slice()</code> function to limit results.</p>

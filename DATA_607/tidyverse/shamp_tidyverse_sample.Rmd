## Data Collection and Cleaning
I am attaching the libraries `tidyverse` and `RCurl` but will suppress their output for the sake of readability. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Bring in the data using readr. 
```{r, results='hide'}
url<-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shampjeff/cuny_msds/master/DATA_607/data/averages.csv"
df<- read_csv(file = url)
```

Cleaning the party names. 
```{r}
df$party[df$party == "I"]<- "Independent"
df$party[df$party == "D"]<- "Democrat"
df$party[df$party == "R"]<-"Republican"
df<-subset(df, select = -c(district, bioguide))
head(df)
```

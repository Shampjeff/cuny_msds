# Accessing SQL Database for HW2

Since this assignment is open ended and not necessarily reproducable I built the SQL database on GCP
and accessed it through RStudio. 

Two things would be need to for access if an outside user wanted to reproduce this exact work. 
1) Access granted to that users IP on my instance of GCP
2) Access to the database password. I have masked it in the assignment as verification that my masking protcol works. 

If a user has both of those pieces of information, they will be able to reproduce this work using the `.Rmd` file.

3. A pizza delivery company classifies its customers by gender and location of residence. The research department has gathered data from a random sample of 1399 customers. 
What is the probability that a customer is not male or does not live with parents? Write your answer as a fraction or a decimal number rounded to four decimal places.

**This is asking for the probability of being female or the probability of not living with parents. Remember to subtract females who are with parents and remove double counted females.**

```{r}
space<-1399
p_female<-(728-252)/space
p_not_parents<-(932-(728-252))/space
print(paste("Prob of female or not with parents",round(p_female+p_not_parents,4)))

```

I think this is the right way to do it, but not sure about two things
1) The need to subtract all the double counted females. 
2) A more efficient way to do this in R.

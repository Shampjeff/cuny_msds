Write a program to find the average of 1000 random digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, or 9. Have the program test to see if the average lies within three standard
deviations of the expected value of 4.5. Modify the program so that it repeats
this simulation 1000 times and keeps track of the number of times the test is
passed. Does your outcome agree with the Central Limit Theorem?


```{r}
for (i in 1:1000){
n<-sample(x = 0:9, size = 1000, replace = T)
std<-sd(n)
x<-mean(n)
Z<- (x-4.5)/std
t<-0
if (Z >= 3 | Z <= -3){
  t<-t+1
}
}
t
```

The average for the 1000 trials is always with three standard deviations of the true mean.

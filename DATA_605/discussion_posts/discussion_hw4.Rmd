# Problem Set 1

Starting with martix A as describe in the assignment. 

```{r}
A<- matrix(c(1,2,3,-1,0,4), byrow=T, nrow=2)
A
```

Computing X and Y, $X=AA^{T}$ and $Y=A^{T}A$

```{r}
X<- A%*%t(A)
Y<- t(A)%*%A
```

Using the built-in functions in R to compute the eigenvectors. Showing the eigen vectors and values of X first. 

```{r}
E_x<-eigen(X)
E_y<-eigen(Y)
E_x
```

And the eigen decomp for Y
```{r}
E_y
```

Indeed one the eigen values nearly zero for matrix $Y$. 

Now using the `svd` function for A
```{r}
svd<-svd(A)
svd
```

We see that these are almost the same, the expection being that some of the signs are incorrect between the two results. Is this because of the unit vector nature of the output?
